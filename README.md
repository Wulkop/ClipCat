# ClipCat
An overwolf in-game overlay to categorize your best gaming clips directly after recording.
## Description
The app ClipCat is designed to make it easier for content creators to categorize their recorded game clips.
With conventional programs like Shadowplay or similar game capture applications, a player can capture his best moves in a video. 
All clips are usually collected in one large folder.
This is problematic when a player clips a lot in a short period of time, because he has to look through and categorize the whole collection of new clips afterwards. ClipCat makes it possible to categorize the latest clip directly after the clip has been recorded by using a game overlay.
Depending on the chosen category, the clip is moved to the appropriate folder. The user can create his own categories. For example, the categories Teamkills, Epic Rounds or Clutches are conceivable for first person shooters. The automatic relocation of the videos saves the user time, because the manual looking through of the clips afterwards is prevented.
